    "## Architecture\n",
    "GPT-3 is derived from the transformer model. It uses the encoder part and is therefore inherently autoregressive in its nature, meaning predictions are conditioned upon past prediction outputted by the model itself. Once you understand the transformer architecture, gpt becomes quite straightforward. The accomplishment in GPT-3 resides in the size of the model which resulted in impressive results and particularly in the area of zero or few shot learning, as will be shown in the examples of this notebook:\n",
